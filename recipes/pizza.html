    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base
      of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
      pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
      traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a
      pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is
      presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In
      casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in
      the hand.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1¼ cups warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons fine salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can plain crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce (such as Don Peppino®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cheese</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens
        and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
        a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until
        smooth, about 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball
        and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with
        plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with
        olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a
        fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup
        sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive
        oil over pizza.
      </li>
      <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very
        dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5
        minutes before slicing into squares.
