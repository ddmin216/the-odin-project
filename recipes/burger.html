    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a
      sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties usually ground meat,
      typically beef placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be
      pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles,
      bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish,
      or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and
      are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese
      is called a cheeseburger.
